Recommendation system using graphs and degree of seperation

#Social Media Recommendation Application
Welcome to the social media recommendation application! This application uses graph concepts and algorithms to calculate the degree of separation between users and make recommendations based on those calculations.

#Graph Concepts
In this application, users are represented as vertices (or nodes) in a graph. The relationships between users are represented as edges connecting the vertices. For example, if User A is friends with User B, there would be an edge connecting the vertices representing User A and User B.

#Algorithms
To calculate the degree of separation between users, we use a modified version of the Breadth-First Search algorithm. This algorithm allows us to efficiently traverse the graph and determine the shortest path between two vertices.

Once the degree of separation between two users is calculated, we use this information to make recommendations. For example, if User A and User C have a degree of separation of 2 (meaning there is a path of length 2 connecting them through mutual friends), we may recommend that User A connect with User C.

#Conclusion
In summary, the social media recommendation application uses graph concepts and algorithms to calculate the degree of separation between users and make recommendations based on those calculations. We hope you find this application helpful in expanding your network on our social media platform!
